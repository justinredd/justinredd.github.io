This is, for now, a collection of quotes I want to access with some degree of ease.

It is also an excuse to get to know Jekyll.

The [source](https://github.com/justinredd/justinredd.github.io) for this site is on GitHub. Go ahead and issue a PR if you have ideas for changing it.

This theme is forked from [Scribble](https://github.com/muan/scribble), which is made by [Mu-An](http://muan.co/).
