>"[A]rt is purposely useless, that its significations are symbolic, internal, poetic -- a host of other things -- whereas architects have to answer to the program, the client, and everything that goes along with the utility function of the building. Let's not confuse the two things."

Richard Serra quoted by Calvin Tomkins | The New Yorker "Man of Steel" | p. 54
