>"'[H]ow can I tell [that story]?' I wailed. 'In the first place I don't understand where it begins and in the second place I'm not sure it has an ending and in the third place even if I understood the ending it wouldn't do me any good because I don't understand the beginning in the first place.'"

Barry Hughart | The Story of the Stone | p. 1
