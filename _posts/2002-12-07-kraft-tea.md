>"Jōshū asked a traveling monk, 'Have you ever been here before?' The monk replied, 'Yes, I have.' Jōshū said, 'Have a cup of tea.' Jōshū asked another visiting monk, 'Have you ever been here before?' The monk said, 'No.' Jōshū said, 'Have a cup of tea.' An attendant monk asked Jōshū, 'Why do you say "Have a cup of tea" to one who had visited before and the same thing to one who has come to see you for the first time?' Jōshū called the attendant's name. The attendant replied, 'Yes, sir.' Jōshū said, 'Have a cup of tea.'"
