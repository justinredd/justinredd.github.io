>"Basic issues that each civilization has to deal with--food, clothing, transportation, but also the initiation of life, the distribution of goods, the protection of health and property--have to disappear. They have to become invisible, like air--the abundance of which has so far been the only excess in human history. No doubt this can be achieved."

Stanislaw Lem | Summa Technologia | p. 37
