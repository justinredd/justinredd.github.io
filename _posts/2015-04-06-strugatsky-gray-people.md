>"And no matter how much the gray people in power despise knowledge, they can't do anything about historical objectivitiy; they can slow it down, but they can't stop it. Despising and fearing knowledge, they will nonetheless inevitabily decide to promote it in order to survive."

Boris and Arkady Strugatsky | Hard to Be a God | p. 146
